	<h1>Clearing Cedar Trees (and My Head)</h1>
	<p style="font-style: italic;">tl;dr: After I left my job, I spent some time cutting trees back home. Ever since then, I've had the mental fortitude to look for jobs. It's weird, but it makes sense to me.</p>

	<hr style="border: 0; border-bottom: 1px dashed #ccc; background: #999;">

	<p>Right before I left Altera/Intel, I had plenty of people ask me what I was going to do.</p>

	<p>I mumbled out the truth, which was that I was going to work on personal projects that reminded me of why I loved coding. And I did that. I'm still doing that.</p>

	<p>But there was another answer that I didn't really talk about...</p>

	<h2>"I'm Gonna Go Cut Trees"</h2>
	    
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">My dad spends some of his spare time clearing Cedar trees for one of our long-time ranching partners.</p>
	    
	<p>Cedar trees are pretty much a nuisance. Not only do they take a toll on peoples' allergies, they also hog water, choking off other trees and grasses. To add insult to injury, Cedar isn't a particularly good wood product, so the damn things are near useless, too.</p>
	    
	<p>During Thanksgiving, he mentioned that there was plenty of work to go around, so I asked if I could join him. For the month of December, I would be spending some time back home, uprooting Cedar trees on a ranch next to the middle of nowhere.</p>

	<h2>Home Is A Small Town In Texas</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Roughly 1200 people live in Rocksprings. Wikipedia puts the town's total area at 1.22 sq. miles. You probably only need 15 minutes to drive up and down every street.</p>
	
	<p>It's a square of homes, businesses, and a school, all surrounded by miles of ranch-lands, connected to the outside world by a few pipes, cables, and some long, winding roads.</p>

	<h2>It's A Town Made For Working</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I mean, obviously every town has work and, obviously, no town is without its fun, but...</p>

	<p>Whenever I think of home, I think of work.</p>

	<p>I think about how I used to spend my summer and winter breaks waking up at 6:00 in the morning; how my mom and grandma would already be up making lunches for us to take to work. I think about how one of my uncles would load up in the back of the truck, while my other uncle took the passenger seat, I took the middle, and my dad drove to pick up the rest of our crew.</p>

	<p>I think about making our way to the ranches while the sun came up; how every caliche road bumped and twisted in its own way. I think about being there all day, in the heat, working with my hands and sweating non-stop. I think about doing a good day's work and then coming home right before the sun would set.</p>
	
	<h2>Things Were Simpler Back Then</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Living in Austin and being a software engineer is...a wildly different life than the one I used to have. Not that I'm compaining, necessarily. Nor am I experiencing culture shock.</p>
	
	<p>I think I just miss the simpler times.</p>
	
	<p>It was never as perfect as I want to remember it, of course. I actually remember hating that life more often than not, but...I spent 10 years working in my family's business.</p>
	
	<p>It was my childhood, basically. It's familiar. And comfortable.</p>

	<h2>But There Had To Be More</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I always wanted to work with computers.</p>
	
	<p>We didn't use them on the ranches, of course; everything was mechanical, out there. But I would watch other people use them.</p>

	<p>My grandma had one to balance the checkbooks for our family business. My aunt used them to manage the finances for the local telephone company. When my mom first moved to town, she did some map-making/CAD stuff for a company that has since closed.</p>

	<h2>Star Trek Was The Real Kicker, Though</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Pretty early into my life, I would watch these crew members tap out commands on futuristic screens. They would steer the ship and conjure up crazy data charts just by pushing some buttons.</p>
	
	<p>I wanted to have a job where I could push buttons on a computer and make cool things happen.</p>

	<p>I would try to find cool programs on our home computers, but never really saw what I was looking for. I kept wondering where those programs were. I knew that somebody out there was making them, but I couldn't wrap my around it.</p>

	<p>I knew about paint programs and CAD programs, but I couldn't understand how computers took those pictures and moved them around to make a game. How did those factories on TV connect a keyboard to a giant assembly line? How did the Space Shuttle computers fly rockets??</p>
	
	<h2>I Knew It Was Programming</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I just didn't know how to do it.</p>
	
	<p style="font-style: italic;">Thinking back on it, I may have just assumed that we didn't have the kind of computer that could be programmed. As if you had to buy a special "programmable" computer if you wanted to do something like that. No, our computer could only run other peoples' programs.</p>

	<p>As I got older, of course, I understood that there were several programming languages and they could be used to direct <i>any</i> computer. I knew that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to make computers do stuff.</p>

	<p>And so began my software life.</p>

	<p>I'm going to fast-forward through college...it's a different story for another day. The long-and-short of it is that I found out I could program computers and I loved it. I found a job at Altera and had an amazing experience creating unique products and kept doing that for almost 7 years.</p>

	<p>But...</p>

	<h2>The Software Life Stopped Being Comfortable</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">As my time at Altera/Intel began to drag me down, it made me feel like I wasn't in the right place.</p>

	<p>Like everything was wrong.</p>
	
	<p>I didn't like coming in to work. I didn't like the way we functioned. I didn't like the project and I didn't like the idea of writing code for something I no longer cared about.</p>

	<p>The worst part was that I knew I wanted to leave, but when I looked at other companies' job postings, I had the exact same thoughts.</p>

	<h2>I Had To Step Away</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Far Away.</p>

	<p>I had to find some place I <i>did</i> like to be. A place where the projects were rewarding and I didn't have to worry about anyone else but me.</p>

	<p>That place turned out to be home.</p>

	<p>The comfort zone of early mornings, empty pastures, and harsh elements. The endless hillsides pocked by the rocks that give home its name. The place that brought me up while I dreamed of computers.</p>
	
	<h2>I Had To Go Back</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Back to the ranches and the machines. Back to the chips and breakfast tacos we packed for a lunch. Back to the dirt that clung to my clothes and hands.</p>

	<p>Back to the simpler times, where everthing made sense.</p>

	<p>For most of December, I would be waking up at 6:00 in the morning. I'd pack up my gear, climb into the driver's seat of my grandpa's truck, and make my way out to the ranch.</p>

	<p>The sun would be coming up.</p>

	<p>All day, I would sit in a Bobcat and use the hydraulic grabber to pull Cedar trees out by their roots. About an hour before the sun was due to set, I'd come back home and wind down while I prepped for the next day.</p>

	<h2>The Algorithm Was Simpler, There</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">See a patch of Cedar, take it down.</p>

	<p>Wiggle it free, if you have to. Set it down, out of the way. Leave behind a cleaner grove of Oaks and Mequites.</p>

	<p>Take one out, put it aside. Find another one, do the same.</p>

	<p>Watch the pasture transform.</p>
	
	<h2>Come Home, Exhausted</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">The tractor's diesel engine wasn't exactly forgiving. It's loud and groaned when you asked it to do work.</p>

	<p>And the trees don't just come up with out a fight, either.</p>

	<p>Having hydraulic arms makes things deceptively easy, but you'll quickly get reminded of how much force is flowing through the system when you try to pick up a tree and end up lifting the back-end of the tractor, instead.</p>

	<p>The tractor needed the occaisional elbow-grease, too.</p>

	<p>Changing a tractor tire with treads as thick as fist is...well, it's tiring. Especially when you have to roll it across the pasture, because the truck can't be driven to that part of the ranch. <i>(I didn't see the pun on first writing, but I do now and it's staying.)</i></p>

	<p>Do a day's work. Come home, exhausted. Prepare to do it again, the next day.</p>

	<h2>The Past Had Become My Present</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I was back there, again. Back where it all started.</p>

	<p>Back where the only ladders to climb were physical, rather than managerial. Back where pieces of a project were welded together, rather than #include-d. Back where shifting gears meant using a clutch.</p>
	
	<p>I started driving my grandpa's truck&ndash;the one he bought the year I was born. "Reconnecting with your roots" doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what it means to walk (or drive, as it were) the same path as your father and grandfather.</p>

	<p>I would think about my new work. About how I was stacking the uprooted trees so they built walls of freshly-pulled Cedar.</p>

	<p>I carved trails between the small forests of trees, unlocking access to even more parts of the ranch. I planned out the next area of attack and kept pushing as far as the rocks would let me.</p>

	<h2>I Found My Serenity</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;"><i>"I like cutting Cedar. It centers me. I'm out there, nothing but the trees and the tractor. I don't have to do anything but pull them out. It's nice."</i>- My dad.</p>

	<p>Sometimes, my dad and I are too much alike.</p>

	<p>I wouldn't say the rest of the world melted away while I was out there. It's more like I could dip my mind into serenity for a little while.</p>

	<p>Long enough to stomp on some of the monsters that were hanging around the code.</p>
	
	<p>Things still sucked, but my mind--and half a pasture of Cedar--was clearer. I had beaten down enough mind-funk to start applying for jobs, again.</p>
	
	<h2>I'm Still Hesitant</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I would hate to jump back into the same mind-drain that sent me to my break in the first place.</p>

	<p>When I'm evaluating jobs, I look for those signs that tell me I'll be hating this in no time. I try to look for companies that care about their products <i>and</i> their people. It's tough. And that's before we even get to the interviews.</p>

	<p>Some are better than others, but one thing is for sure...</p>
	
	<h2>I Could Not Have Interviewed Before My Break</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Before I left, the common advice was to have a "next job" all set up.</p>

	<p>In other words, I shouldn't actually take a break. Maybe I could relax for a week or two, but I should still keep working.</p>

	<p>I think I did one or two interviews, but only because they were teed-up for me by former co-workers. Interviewing with familiar faces wasn't so daunting.</p>

	<p>But, having been through several phone screenings, coding tests, and on-site interviews, I can say, for certain, I could NOT have handled ANY of it before the break.</p>

	<p>It can be tough to handle now. Trying to handle it back then, when I was so disenchanted by the industry, would've have absolutely crushed me.</p>

	<p>Even if I had landed one of these jobs, I would've started the job already hating it. I would have been in the same mental place that caused me to quit Intel, before I'd even given the next company a real chance.</p>

	<h2>Today Is A Different Story, Though</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I'm excited to see what companies have to offer.</p>

	<p>I'm excited to build software, again. Excited to work with new sets of engineers on interesting products. Excited to bring value to a new team.</p>

	<p>But we'll have to see how things go.</p>

	<p>So far, the job hunt has been slower than I would like. And even when I get some of the later-stage interviews, I seem to be punching below my level. Not performing as well as I know I can.</p>

	<p>It's not the most wonderful thing when it happens, but at least I'm able to take it in stride.</p>
	
	<p style="font-style: italic;">A fact that I owe to my time back home.</br>
