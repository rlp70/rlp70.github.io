	<h1>Wait...What Day Is It???</h1>
	<p style="font-style: italic;">tl;dr: Between life and work, I didn't realize how much time has passed. Let's see how much catching up we can do.</p>

	<hr style="border: 0; border-bottom: 1px dashed #ccc; background: #999;">

	<p>I guess I'm still having trouble when it comes to writing. I wish I knew what was going on with that. It could be as simple as not having a comfortable enough chair or it could be that my brain is truly fried.</p>

	<p>I know I never made any promise to keep a blog, but it does bother me that I appear to have so little to say, especially since my mind is always running. And I don't just mean about work, either. There's other stuff I'd like to write, but I just can't seem to sit down and get the words out.</p>

	<h2>Let's Start With Work</h2>	    
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">The excitement continues.</p>

	<p>Of course, it's not always sunshine and rainbows, but as the months have gone on, I feel like I've levelled-up. Not only is this what I wanted, but I'm also enjoying it.</p>

	<p>As I said before, it's been rewarding to be able to focus on my output and to know that nothing I do is wasted effort. There have been a few moments where I feel like I'm just spinning my wheels, but more often than not, it turns out to be a useful and important endeavour.</p>

	<h2>So What Do I Do, Now?</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I work in a small-team/startup environment, so the workload consists of something like..."Do Everything."</p>
	
	<p>There's a lot of code to write, which...aside from the fact that some of the tasks are presenting their own challenges, there's an added challenge that there's no one else to blame things on. Any bad and/or garbage code could really only have been written by me. That's not something I'm used to, just yet, but I'm feeling better about it by the day.</p>

	<p>To go along with the code, there's the infrastructure. Even when you use an off-the-shelf build tool, there's a lot of supporting files to keep in check. But when you find out the standard tools won't provide you with enough flexibility for your needs so you have to write your own stuff? Yeah, that's work, too. So far, things have been ok, but the rough roads are just around the corner.</p>
	
	<p>Then, there's the documentation. Like most companies, we're a little light on our specs and test plans. Unlike most companies, we don't have architects to go away and write those docs. It's all on us! Thankfully, I enjoy writing, so taking on these tasks is only helping me.</p>

	<p>Sometimes it feels like plate-spinning, except I'm not sure I remembered to check every plate. It's fun though. And rewarding, which is the most important thing about taking this job in the first place.</p>

	<h2>Mental Health Matters</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I took this job because I felt like it was the just the right environment to ease me back into the industry. So far, I've been right.</p>
	
	<p>I'm still learning new things and stretching myself, but never feeling like I'm being worn thin. I owe this to my coworkers and the work environment that the company has been able to create.</p>

	<p>We still have our deadlines and mountains of tasks to do, but we are moving steadily forward. We still have our issues that stump us and frustrations about which solution is right, but we never feel like we're under the gun.</p>

	<p>Or at least, I never feel that way.</p>

	<p>In the end, that's the thing that helps the most. I don't have to worry about how to avoid the pressure. Instead, I can concentrate on my work and my skills as an engineer.</p>

	<h2>On The Life Side</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">A few months ago, I bought a house. Whaaat!</p>

	<p>Yeah. I'd been on the lookout for a house for a long time and finally managed to work something out. And the past few months, I've been making it "mine."</p>

	<p>The house sits on very private hillside, which is a rare find these days. However, the hillside is prone to soil erosion, so I've been spending a few hours every weekend working it.</p>

	<p>It's a weird mix, when you think about it.</p>

	<p> I wake up on Saturdays and Sundays, make some breakfast, write some code, and then go outside to excavate some of the hillside. It's almost like a life-balance between my computer-centric side and my hard-labor side. I think this is why the time passed me by without me even noticing.</p>

	<p>I stopped thinking about what day it was and starting thinking about what parts of the hillside I would tackle next. But the good thing is...I've enjoyed this time and it's kept me in a good center.</p>
	
	<h2>To Wrap This Up</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I have no idea when my next post will come around. I'm just glad I managed to get this one out.</p>
	
	<p>Things have been a blur, but I'm hoping things settle down by next summer. But don't hesitate to check up on me, if you're curious about how I'm doing!</p>
		
	<p style="font-style: italic;">If anything good happens, though, I'll be sure to let you know :)</br>
