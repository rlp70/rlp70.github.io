      <h1>Time For A Break</h1>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">I wanted this post to be something...more. But it's just an update.</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">tl;dr: After 6.75 years in the software industry, I'm leaving my job at Intel. I plan to take a break to clear my head & focus on my own stuff. Hopefully things work out in my favor.</p>
      <hr style="border: 0; border-bottom: 1px dashed #ccc; background: #999;">
      <p>Today, October 5th, is my last day at Intel PSG, formerly Altera. After 6.75 years, I'm taking some time away from the software engineering industry.</p>
      
      <p>It's been quite the journey...I've done some work that I'm extremely proud of, I've built a pretty good set of (particular?) skills, and I've come to know some really awesome people. In many ways, I'm sorry to be leaving.</p>
      
      <h2>But in other ways...not so much.</h2>
      <p>I wouldn't say I've had to endure anything excessively awful. It's stuff every engineering company likely faces, but there have definitely been some tough times. Some times have been tougher than others, but no matter how trivial the issues, these things wear on everyone.</p>

      <p>Everything with me is generally (alright, alright,) alright, but...for a (really long) while now, I've been wanting to find a new job. This is for a number of reasons, both personal and technical, but every time I looked at postings, I just...could not get with it.</p>

      <p>I couldn't get excited for applying. I couldn't gin up motivation to take on interviews. I dreaded the idea of coming into a new organization, only to find the exact. same. awful. processes.</p>

      <h2>I'm extremely fortunate...</h2>
      <p>The fact is that I don't have to put myself through all of that. I can choose to step away for a minute and clear my mind.</p>
      
      <p>So that's what I'm going to do.</p>
      
      <p>I'm going to take some time away to work on my own "for fun" projects that I haven't had much time for, lately. Projects that are personally rewarding and make me remember why I love writing code.</p>

      <h2>I'm hoping this is a short break.</h2>
      <p>I'm not trying to put a timeline on things...whatever happens, happens.</p>

      <p>Even if it means leaving the engineering industry, my ultimate goal is to find out what's right for me. A shorter break is simply nicer for me financially, but everything has to be worth it in "the big picture."</p>

      <h2>This is just an update.</h2>
      <p>I usually have a point to make...a lesson to convey or advice to offer. I wanted this post have more of that, but that's not what this is about. This is just an update.</p>

      <p>Because this all sounds fun, at first. Who wouldn't want to walk away from work for an unknown amount of time & not have to worry? In the bigger picture, though...</p>

      <p>I'm having to take out money I've been putting away for other stuff, like a house or a car. Or so many other things I would like to be able to do. I'm pretty unhappy at the thought that taking too long a break could mean setting myself back by 5 or more years.</p>

      <p>I come from a hard-labor upbringing. I know what real work is and I know what people go through to get their bills paid. I know that what I'm doing here is unusual and isn't something that everyone can do.</p>

      <h2>But I'm doing it because I need to.</h2>
      <p>I need to figure out if I'm just stressed out or if I'm really, truly unhappy with this industry.</p>
      
      <p>I don't expect anyone to understand. (Although, many people have already mentioned to me that they do.) I don't expect anyone to follow. I don't expect anyone to take this as anything more than an update.</p>
      
      <h2>But if you would allow me to say this: Take care of yourself.</h2>
      <p>Things aren't always easy.</p>

      <p>Some people handle tough times better than others. It doesn't really matter if you're one of them or not...take care of yourself. Even if that means having to step away from a very comfortable job so that you can figure out what will make your life better.</p>
      
      <h2>I'll be around.</h2>
      <p>Hopefully I'll have good news to share with you, soon. But until then, I'll be around.</p>
      
      <p>I'll be working on projects, some of which I'll keep to myself, some of which I might try to share. I'll be playing softball, watching football games, and trying the next release of Pumpkinator. I'll be lifting, catching up on shows, and taking as many chances as I can get to catch up with people.</p>

      <p>I'll be around, so feel free to hit me up.</p>
      
      <p style="font-style: italic;">Take care,</br>
