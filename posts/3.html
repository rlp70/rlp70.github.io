	<h1>A Quick New Job Update</h1>
	<p style="font-style: italic;">tl;dr: I haven't been able to sit down and write everything I want to. Hopefully I fix that. Until then: I managed to land a job & it's pretty exciting.</p>

	<hr style="border: 0; border-bottom: 1px dashed #ccc; background: #999;">

	<p>I'm long overdue on posting an update, but I just can't seem to sit down and write. It's been a personal frustration of mine for the past few months, so hopefully I get it all sorted out, soon.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>Since I can't seem to get the whole story down on paper&ndash;and since you've probably already seen the title change on my LinkedIn card&ndash;let me just dump it here as a quick update: Thanks to a former co-worker and some really cool people, I now have a job at <a href="https://www.tactuallabs.com" target="_blank">Tactual Labs</a>.</p>

	<h2>I'm Kind Of Excited About It</h2>
	    
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I'm working on a new project in a small company, so I'll have plenty of influence and responsibilities, but there's just...more to it than that.</p>
	    
	<p>There's meaning and connection behind everything I'm doing. There's never a moment where I feel like I'm not doing valuable work. There's a deference being shown to me that feels more like a show of respect for my talents than an unwillingness to get involved.</p>

	<p>In everything I do, there's equal parts learning that benefits me and progress that benefits the project.</p>
	
	<h2>I've Even Impressed Myself</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Looking back on the past two months of work, I can say I feel accomplished.</p>

	<p>I've done some architecting for the project&ndash;and there's still more to be done in the coming months. I've made some fairly extensive additions to an open-source tool. We'll see if we ever upstream those additions, but the fact that I was able to do them is just...I'm proud of that. I've learned some bits about how gdb works, which...trust me, you don't ever want to have to peek under the hood of something like gdb.</p>
	
	<p>In this short time, I've done and learned quite a bit and it's proven to be a very rewarding dip back into the industry.</p>

	<h2>I've Also Noticed...</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I'm always excited to chip away at the next task.</p>

	<p>I haven't felt that way in a long time. It kinda goes without saying, but...I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the project.</p>

	<p>This has been a wonderful return to the industry and I'm extremely thankful for it.</p>
	
	<h2>As I Said Earlier</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I've been having trouble getting the stories out. (Even getting this down was a bit of a struggle.)</p>
	
	<p>I'll do my best to fix this, because there's plenty of things left to say, BUT...if it should take me a while, just know that there's a lot of interesting and exciting things happening, right now.</p>
		
	<p style="font-style: italic;">Thanks for following along :)</br>
