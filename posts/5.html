	<h1>The Little Things</h1>
	<p style="font-style: italic;">tl;dr: Make the effort to do "The Little Things." Engineering desperately needs it.</p>

	<hr style="border: 0; border-bottom: 1px dashed #ccc; background: #999;">

	<p>Here's an undeniable fact: High School Football is the lifeblood of Texas.</p>

	<p>Every Fall, schools orient themselves around the sport of (American) football, so that even if you don't really follow it, you're very well aware of it. And the smaller the school, the more central the sport becomes.</p>

	<h2>Friday Night Lights</h2>	    
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I really can't explain it. The Friday Night Lights are real. And for the many, (many!) small towns across Texas, they're the brightest lights in the city.</p>

	<p>You can probably guess that I played football, back in high school. I really miss those days. My Senior season was quite a ride.</p>

	<p>But this story is about my head-coach.</p>

	<h2>Coaches</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">There's an idea floating around that's used to justify our widespread devotion to athletics in schools: <i>Participation in sports helps to build character and better-prepare our youth for their post-school lives.</i></p>

	<p>I'm not going to argue whether this is completely true or not, I'm just going to say that this aspect of sports education really depends on your coaches. Teaching is a difficult task, and so is having to mix teaching with athletics. Some coaches do it better than others, is all I'm saying.</p>

	<p>That's why I've been thinking about my coach.</p>

	<p>At the time, he was the guy that you thought had too big a head; he was too full of himself and just seemed to be speak non-sensical coaching-phrases.</p>

	<p>But, as it would turn out, my coach buried a lot of wisdom into those "non-sensical" phrases.</p>

	<h2>"It's The Little Things"</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Like...that's it. That's what he would say.</p>
	
	<p>I know, now, what he was actually saying, but imagine hearing this in high school...</p>

	<p>It's late in the day. You're tired from hours of practice in the hot, Texas sun. And now your coach is yelling this at you because you were <i>walking</i> to your spot, instead of <i>running</i> there. You would've thought, just like I did, that Coach was making an effort to find something to complain about.</p>

	<p>But now that I'm older, I can hear the words and understand their meaning.</p>

	<h2>It's About the Difference</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">"The Little Things" are the difference between The Good and The Great.</p>

	<p>The great teams, he would say, are the ones that do "The Little Things." The great players, he'd say, did "The Little Things." Championships were earned by doing "The Little Things" and doing them right.</p>
	
	<p>When I was walking to my spot, my opponents were running. When I wasn't properly throwing my elbow on a practice route, my opponents were perfecting their motions. When I wasn't doing "The Little Things," my opponents were.</p>
	
	<p>And that's why, when we faced off against a perennial powerhouse for the District Title, we won.</p>
	<p>It turns out that, up until that point in the season, they were winning games by such wide margins that they basically coasted through the last quarters of their games. By contrast, we had to take all of our games right down to the wire; never able to let up until the game was actually over. So, when we finally faced off against each other, we were better-prepared to play the game to the very end, which we did, in overtime.</p>

	<p>They had been walking. We had been running.</p>
	
	<h2>Beyond Football</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Obviously, this post is about engineering, not football. And I'm writing it because there are So. Many. Little. Things. in engineering.</p>

	<p>I guess, because I grew up in this frame of reference, I see Engineering Teams as Football Teams. And I constantly see them fail to do "The Little Things."</p>
	
	<p>We don't make genuine attempts at documentation. We don't do disciplined code reviews. We don't leave adequate comments or give our variables descriptive names.</p>

	<p>There are so many "Little Things" that we don't do that would make our Good projects Great; that would make our Good teams Great.</p>

	<h2>But...</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I need to pause...because I haven't been able to figure out where to take the rest of this post.</p>

	<p>This has been in my drafts for weeks, because I was trying to figure out why, over and over again, Teams don't end up doing The Little Things. I was trying to list all of the bad behaviors, so I could offer corrections. I was trying to convince you (and your teams) that your goal is to be a Great Team, not just a Good one.</p>

	<p>But that's not my job.</p>

	<h2>It's Your Choice</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">No matter how much coaching we got, it was ultimately on us, as players, to decide what we were going to do.</p>

	<p>Were we going to do <i>all</i> of The Little Things, or not? Because if we weren't going to make up our minds to do them, then it didn't matter what Coach said...we had made our choice to be this good, but no better.</p>
	
	<p>Every Team has their reasons for being as good, or as bad, as they are. Sometimes, the reasons are understandable. But all too often, Teams <i>choose</i> mediocraty, because that's the choice that reflects who they are.</p>

	<p>Maybe I'm just being too cynical, but I think I've just run out of patience...</p>

	<h2>Priorities</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">I've been able to see what teams prioritize when they're under crunch, and I've also been able to see what they do when they have plenty of time on their hands.</p>

	<p>And it's never good.</p>

	<p>Everyone always seems to prioritize "Getting It Done," rather than "Getting It Done, Right." And this is the attitude at the root of terrible Teams: It's more important to ship, than it is to deliver.</p>

	<p>From Upper-Management, on down to the lowest Implementer, the priority is to finish. Quality is just a goal, and usually one that Management hopes will appear from thin air.</p>

	<p>And that's the attitude I can no longer stand.</p>

	<h2>Garbage In, Garbage Out</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">We have the excuses ready...about not having the time/resources/etc. But at the end of the day, we get out what we put in.</p>

	<p>And as long as we, as an industry, commit to the "Always Be Shipping" mentality (or whatever variant of that you can think of), then we're committing to making "Doing It Right" a secondary goal.</p>

	<p>And as long as "Do It Right" isn't the top priority (like...real...priority, not just a management "value"), then we aren't putting in our best. So we won't <i>get</i> our best.</p>

	<p>We won't actually make the best products. We won't deliver high-quality software. We'll send out these shiny boxes and hope they don't become dumpster fires.</p>

	<p>How fun for us! <i>/s</i></p>
	
	<h2>This Takes Practice</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">Just like a football team needs practice, so too does an engineering team.</p>

	<p>The Little Things, like clean & solid code, don't just happen. They're done on purpose. And doing things on purpose takes practice.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, engineering doesn't really separate the practice field from the game-day field.</p>

	<p>When you go to work, you're showing up for both. You have to figure out how to improve yourself as you're being your best self.</p>

	<p>The truly tough part? You have to get your team to practice, too.</p>
	
	<h2>"Make An Effort"</h2>
	<p style="margin-top: 0px;">This is another one of Coach's sayings.</p>

	<p>It's really just "Do your best" in disguise, but it was always said in a particular context: When you're up against a monumental task (such as convincing your Team to prioritize "Do It Right" over "Get It Done"), you're very likely to fail, but you can make great progress with a sincere effort.</p>

	<p>This post is very...chastising, but I do understand that this is a huge problem that will go unsolved in the industry, possibly forever. Actually, the enormity of the problem is one of the major reasons why I stalled on this post for so long.</p>

	<p>But at least I (and hopefully, we) can make sincere efforts to change things, and see appreciable progress as we do so.</p>
